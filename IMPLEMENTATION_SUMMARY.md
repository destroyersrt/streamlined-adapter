## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Adapter Usage
```python
from streamlined_adapter import StreamlinedAdapter

adapter = StreamlinedAdapter(agent_id="my_agent")
adapter.start_server()
```

### Agent Discovery
```python
result = adapter.discover_agents("I need to analyze sales data")
print(f"Found {len(result['recommended_agents'])} suitable agents")
```

### Telemetry Monitoring
```python
health = adapter.get_health_status()
metrics = adapter.get_metrics_summary(hours=24)
telemetry_data = adapter.export_telemetry(format="json")
```

### Command Line
```bash
streamlined-adapter --agent-id my_agent --port 6000
nanda-discover "Create a dashboard for analytics"
```
